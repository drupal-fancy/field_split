This module can split field values into multiple fields on the Manage display
page. Imagine you have an entity reference field with two values and the first
one should goes into region "Left" and the other one goes into region "Right".
Currently you only have one field which you can move into a region but with this
module you can split that field so that you have 2 fields.

INSTALLATION
------------
